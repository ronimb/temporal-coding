# Create pandas array to contain number_of_repetitions items with pre, post, diff and distance
# Iterate number_of_repetitions times
#   Create stimuli set
#   TODO: Change the following behaviour, wrap the object in a training function
#   Create tempotron object
#   Create classification network
#   Calculate accuracy  pre accuracy over entire set
#   Divide set into training and test_sets (use indexes to conserve memory)
#   Train with training set
#   Calculate post accuracy over test_set
#   Calculate diff
